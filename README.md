Hello, I'm Chris Rebuck, I began my journey into the world of software development a short time ago.  I have completed LaunchCode's LC 101 JavaScript and Java Web Development Course in July 2021 and I continue to educate myself to further expand my knowledge and skills.  I am excited, motivated, and determined to grow as a professional in this field and continue to develop the skills I need in order to create a positive impact on the lives of others.  This is something I am passionate about despite the challenges I have faced.  I will continue to embrace new challenges and continue my journey through this exciting world of technology.  

“Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.” --   Theodore Roosevelt

I am ready for the challenge!
