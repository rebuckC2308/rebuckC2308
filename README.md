Greetings, I'm Chris. I have challenged myself to grow as a software developer/engineer in 2025.  It is easy to make excuses and tell yourself you're getting better each day because that's what I've done in 2024.  I've made the mistake of not challenging myself to develop the skills and experience necessary to get me to where I want to go.  I won't allow myself to remain content because I want more for myself.  I demand more of myself.  So this is the beginning of my next journey as a professional.  I have courses I want to complete, skills I want to further develop, and projects I want to complete. As a dedicated husband and father to an amazing son with another little guy on the way, I know I'll have my work cut out for me.  This won't be easy... easy doesn't demand growth and sacrifice.  

“Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.” --   Theodore Roosevelt

Let the journey begin...
