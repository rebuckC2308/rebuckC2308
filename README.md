Hello, I'm Chris Rebuck, a newby when it comes to the world of software development.  I have recently completed LaunchCode's LC 101 JavaScript and Java Web Development Course in July 2021.  I am excited, motivated, and determined to develop the skills I need in order to create a positive impact on my team, the company, as well as the user's.  This is something I am passionate about despite the challenges I have faced.  I embrace the challenges and continue to persevere.  

“Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.” --   Theodore Roosevelt

I am ready for the challenge and eager for my journey to begin!
